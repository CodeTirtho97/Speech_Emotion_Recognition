# Speech Emotion Recognition Using the TESS Dataset

This project is a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that classifies emotions in speech audio files using the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset. It employs audio preprocessing techniques, MFCC feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to predict emotions such as Angry, Happy, Sad, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a crucial task in understanding human emotions from audio signals, with applications in customer service, healthcare, and AI-driven assistants. This project builds a pipeline that:
1. Processes audio data.
2. Extracts meaningful features (MFCCs).
3. Trains machine learning models to classify emotions.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)
- **Description**: ~2800 clean WAV files labeled with 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Pleasant Surprise, and Sad.
- **Actors**: Two female speakers aged 26 and 64.
- **Format**: WAV files recorded at a sampling rate of 24,000 Hz.
- **Link**: [TESS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess)

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Extract **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** features.
   - Normalize and balance the dataset.
   - Split into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train multiple machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Identify the best-performing model.
4. **Generalization**:
   - Test the selected model on unseen data.
